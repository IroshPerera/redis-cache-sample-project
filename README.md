# Redis Cache Sample Project

This project demonstrates the integration of Redis as a caching mechanism within a Spring Boot application. The goal is to showcase how Redis can enhance performance and scalability by reducing the load on databases and other backend services.

## Key Features
- **Redis Integration:** Implements caching with Redis to store and retrieve frequently accessed data.
- **Performance Optimization:** Caches results of database queries to reduce load and improve response times.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Utilizes in-memory caching to handle high traffic efficiently.
- **Example Use Cases:** Caching database queries, API responses, and session data.
